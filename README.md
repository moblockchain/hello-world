# hello-world
This is my first repository.

I am Andy Keen.

Blockchain technologies have motivated me to learn more about web development, coding, and smart contracts.

I do NOT know what I am doing yet, but I am here to learn.

Feedback would be awesome!

I have two W-2 jobs and also position trade medium-sized stocks.

My first Blockchain asset purchase was May 8th or 9th, 2017.

My professional experiences are guiding my Blockchain and coding interests in...

Insurance, Agriculture, Government, and Low-Vision Accessibility.
